# where the outcome is treatment. Include the 8 confounding variables in
# the model as predictors, with no interaction terms or non-linear terms (such as
# squared terms). Obtain the propensity score for each subject. Next, obtain the
# inverse probability of treatment weights for each subject.

# What are the minimum and maximum weights?
